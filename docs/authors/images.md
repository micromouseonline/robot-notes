# Placing Images

A good picture is often a great benefit to an article. These are easy enough to add to any
markdown document by using an entry like this for an externally stored image:

`![Alt Text](Image Location "Image Title")`

Where you replace the `Alt Text` with some appropriate text to be used by screenreaders or
as a fallback in case the image fails to load. Search engines also use the `Alt Text` when 
indexing pages. The `Image Location` is any valid path or URL for the image file. 
The `Image Title` is optional and will normally only appear when you hover 
the mouse over the image.

## Remote Images

This image is a randomly selected placeholder from the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) site

`![random image](https://picsum.photos/id/237/640/200 "Random Image" )`
![random image](https://picsum.photos/id/237/640/200 "Random Image" )

Leave an empty line before and after the image to ensure that the image lives in a pargraph
on its own. Images default to being left-aligned. An image that is wider than the available 
space will be scaled down to fit.  The pages generated by Material for MkDocs are responsive 
so it is not, in general, possible to select an image size that will exactly fill the space 
unless you just make it very big.


## Local Images

For images stored locally on the site, use a path that is relative to the docs folder in the
repository. That is the folder that  source documents live in so, if you are working on a document 
in a folder inside that, you might use a path like this

`![Alt Text](../assets/placeholder-640x300.jpg "A locally stored image")`
![Alt Text](../assets/placeholder-640x300.jpg "A locally stored image")

## Captions

Although markdown has no provision for captions, Material for MkDocs has an alternative
syntax that will get he job done. The caption will be centred below the image

```
![Alt Text](../assets/placeholder-640x100.jpg)`
/// caption
The Image Caption
///
```

![Alt Text](../assets/placeholder-640x100.jpg)
/// caption
The Image Caption
///

Any text you place between the `/// caption` and `///` lines will appear as a centre aligned caption 
below the image.

You  will see that this has the interesting side-effect of making the image aligned to the centre
of the page content area. In fact, this appears to be one of the easiest ways to centre an image.
Simply add the caption markup but without the actual caption text. 

## Alignment

There are two options provided for aligning images to the left or right of the text allowing text to 
flow around the image.

### Left aligned
`![Alt Text](../assets/tiger-100x90.png){ align=left }`

![Alt Text](../assets/tiger-100x90.png){ align=left }
Place the Image before the text. This makes the image float left with any subsequent text flowing 
around the image. This may be what you want but you may prefer an image with a short piece of text 
beside it and with the remaining text starting underneath in a new paragraph. The usual method
of leaving a blank line to start a new paragraph will not work here and you will need to
use some basic css to clear the float. 

Sommething like this:
```
![Alt Text](../assets/tiger-100x90.png){ align=left }
<br>Cute Cat!
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
```
![Alt Text](../assets/tiger-100x90.png){ align=left }
<br>I have been waiting some time for my dinner and, frankly, enough is enough.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
Now we are on a new line in a fresh paragraph.


### Right Aligned
Everything that applies to left-aligned images also works with right aligned images. You 
just replace `align=left` with `align=right`

```
![Alt Text](../assets/tiger-100x90.png){ align=right }
<br>Cute Cat!
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
```
![Alt Text](../assets/tiger-100x90.png){ align=right }
<br>So, how about some food? You won't like me when I am hungry.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
