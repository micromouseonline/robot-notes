# Wall and Line Sensors for Your Robot

Whether you are building a line follower or a maze running robot, you are going to need some kind of sensors to detect the local environment. For maze-based micromouse robots and line-following robots, the working environment is very constrained so there is no real need to consider exotic, long-range sensing solutions. For both types of robot, it is possible to use quite simple reflected light sensors. Not only are these easy to design and construct, they are fast and reliable. Beginner and training robots may not be running around at great speed but competitive, high-performance robots can be travelling at speeds in excess of 5000mm/s. Even if measurements are taken 1000 times per second, the robot may have moved 5mm or more on the ground. Fortunately, the kinds of optical sensors described here are capable of producing readings in a very short period at high frequencies.
